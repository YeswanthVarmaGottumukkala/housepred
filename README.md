# 📝 Automatic Subjective Answer Evaluation using XLNet

This project is an AI-powered system to automatically evaluate descriptive student answers. It combines **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** with **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to extract text from scanned images and evaluate the answers using semantic similarity with a reference answer.
